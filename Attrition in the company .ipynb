    " The gradual reduction in the number of employees is called employee attrition. Over time, employee turnover occurs when the workforce size is reduced. That means that the workers are leaving more quickly than they've been hired. Attrition occurs when employees retire, resign, or simply don't get replaced.\n",
    " \n",
    " There are various reasons why employees may leave their jobs. These include dissatisfaction with compensation or perks, a dearth of chances for professional growth, and even unfavourable working circumstances.Certain jobs eventually become outdated in a world where the skill sets needed are ever-changing. Not every position is filled in the same formulaic manner when workers depart and a new paradigm of work arises.\n",
    " \n",
    " An organisation may face many challenges due to a high rate of attrition. Inadequate institutional knowledge, training gaps, and a lack of continuity are all possible. Positions can take a long time to fill, particularly specialised tasks. If you keep these important positions unfilled, it may become more difficult to fill them in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your current staff members must take up the slack, and the additional workload may lead to burnout. This decreases overall productivity, which negatively impacts your bottom line and results in disgruntled customers.\n",
    " \n",
    " Reduction in workforce is another term for employee attrition in an organisation. Accordingly, attrition may occur voluntarily or involuntarily.Employee attrition can be a concern since it frequently results in a decline in talent within the organisation and the workforce as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to determine the reasons behind employees' voluntary departures and any barriers that may have kept them from quitting."
